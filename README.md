# Svelte + Spicetify Creator

Sveltify Creator is a tool to compile modern Typescript/Javascript code to Spicetify extensions and custom apps, now with Svelte too

## Get started
To get started, use this template, and clone the repo using  `git clone <your repo>`. Then, use `npm install` inside it to install all the dependencies.

To build your extension, use `npm run build-local` to build it locally, or `npm run build` to build it and put it inside your spiceticy folder. To see the extension, add the extension.js to your config-xpui.ini (`spicetify -c`), then use `spicetify apply` to apply the changes.

## Features
- Typescript, React and Svelte syntax
- Import node packages
- CSS/SCSS with PostCSS support
- Extremely fast compile time with esbuild.
- Plugins
